								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Profile.jpeg" alt="" /></span>My name is Santiago Moliner, and I am a game developer. I’ve always wanted to create my own games, I love that feeling of accomplishment after finishing a project, seeing others enjoying what I’ve created. I grew up playing video games that really captivated me as a child, since I always thought to myself that one day I would be making them. The games that inspired me the most are the Dark Souls saga, Battlefield, Bioshock Infinite, Age of Empires and if I had to choose my favorite game i would say Bloodborne. I aspire to one day create a game that can inspire other people as other games did with me. You can check out some of my games and projects here to download or even check the source code.</p>
								<p>Right now, I’m developing games and projects on my own and with teams to improve my programming and team management skills. I would like to start developing clean code for a game studio and feel part of a team and create games that I'm proud of. In the future, I would like to create my own video game studio, since I like taking risks and having more responsibility.</p>
								<p>I specialize in coding, making it work efficiently and readable to other team members. I also really enjoy learning about the algorithms behind all the code that I take for granted, since I believe it gives me a deeper understanding of what I'm really doing. My main points of interest and research are virtual reality and artificial intelligence, I believe those are key topics that will increase in popularity and demand as time goes on. In my free time I enjoy playing the piano, working out, and of course playing some video games.</p>

								<p>I mainly program in C++ low level as you can check in my different projects. I also have used several game engines, mainly Unreal Engine 4 and Unity, but also I’ve also worked with custom engines that I myself developed or were developed with a team. With most of my team software projects we have used tools like Git and GitHub in order to manage all the different commits, with the use of specific branches.</p>
